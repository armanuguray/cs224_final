- Optimization: put all the particles in a glGenBuffer and use 
  attributes. Avoids lots of shader binding/unbding when rendering
  wave particles. Need per-particle attributes for enabling/disabling
  the rendering of a particle (e.g. don't render dead particles).
  - Actually this optimization causes the program to always draw all
    the particles, which sucks. Forget that!

So it looks like the problem with the normal is because the particles
are individual particles, and not wavefronts. My understanding is that
'wavefronts' are actually groups of particles that can't get more
than (small number * radius) away from each other.

TODO
- Rewrite what we currently have to
	- Draw wave particles as single pixels in textures
	- Separated convoluation filters for generating the heights
- Look at the dissertation, investigate projected heightmap for
  infinite ocean rendering
