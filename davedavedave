X Nix the current particle demo
X For now, swap the Fresnel shader with a simple lambertian diffuse
  shader (to make looking at particles easier)
- Render wave particles to texture
	X Set up a framebuffer object
	X Choose the bounds of the heightmap relative to the world
	X Create a texture with format R32, or something else with 1
	  channel and pretty good precision
	X Attach this texture to the FBO
	- Write a fragment shader that
		- Maps the texcoords of a quad to world-space 
 		  heightmap coordinates
		- Uses waveparticles.pdf Eq. 7 to render each particle 
		  to the height map
	X Set additive blending mode
	X Draw a screen aligned quad using the above shader
- Fragment shader to blit the heightmap to the screen for testing
- Fragment shader to just render the heightmap onto the projected grid
  (the heightmap's a texture anyways) for testing
- Vertex shader to perturb Y coords according to paper
- Vertex shader to perturn X/Z coords according to paper
- Wave fronts
- Put the Fresnel shader back in


- May need to change settings::grid_resolution
